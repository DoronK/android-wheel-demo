Android Wheel Demos
===================

This repository contains a Android project to demonstrate the
correct use of Android Wheel component.

If you got into this repository without Android Wheel 
knowledge, I recommend you to give a look at
<https://github.com/derekstavis/android-wheel> before continuing.

How to use
----------

1. Clone this repo

    git clone git://github.com/derekstavis/android-wheel-demo.git

2. Import it into Eclipse/ADT
3. Run it

Submodules are fun
------------------

The main Android component is packed in it own repo, and included inside this repo as a submodule. I recommend you to use the same approach, as any update/bugfix made to the mainline can be pulled without hassle to your project.
